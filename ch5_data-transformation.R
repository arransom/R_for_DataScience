# 5.2 Filter Rows with filter() ------------------------------------------------

# Exercises

# Find all flights that:

# Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120)

# Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
filter(flights, dest == 'IAH' | dest == 'HOU')
# or
filter(flights, dest %in% c('IAH', 'HOU'))

# Were operated by United, American, or Delta
filter(flights, carrier == 'UA' | carrier == 'AA' | carrier == 'DL')
# or
filter(flights, carrier %in% c('UA', 'AA', 'DL'))

# Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
filter(flights, month == 7 | month == 8 | month == 9)
# or
filter(flights, month %in% c(7, 8, 9))
# or
filter(flights, between(month, 7,9))

# Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late
filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120 & dep_delay <= 0)

# Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
filter(flights, dep_delay >= 60 & (dep_delay - arr_delay >= 30))

# Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
filter(flights, dep_time ==2400 | dep_time <=600)
# or
filter(flights, dep_time %in% c(0:600, 2400))
       
# Another useful dplyr filtering helper is between(). What does it do? 
# Answer: 'between()' selects the values of a numeric vector that fall within
#         a specified range

# Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?
# Answer: You can use it to simplify some of the code, however it only works
#         with numeric variables

# How many flights have a missing dep_time? What other variables are missing? 
count(filter(flights, is.na(dep_time)))
# Answer: 8255 flights have missing departure times.  They also have missing
#         departure delays, arrival times and arrival delays, and air time. 

# What might these rows represent?
# Answer: These rows might represent cancelled flights. 

# Why is NA ^ 0 not missing? 
NA ^ 0
# Answer: Because any number raised to the zero degree equals 1.  

# Why is NA | TRUE not missing? 
NA | TRUE
# Answer: Becaues TRUE *or* any other value evaluates to TRUE

# Why is FALSE & NA not missing? 
FALSE & NA
# Answer: Because FALSE *and* any other value evaluates to FALSE

# Can you figure out the general rule? (NA * 0 is a tricky counterexample!)
# Answer: If a statement or equation would evaluate to a specific, static 
#         result no matter what the missing value may be, it will not evaluate
#         to NA.



# 5.3 Arrange Rows with arrange() ----------------------------------------------

# How could you use arrange() to sort all missing values to the start? 
# (Hint: use is.na()).
arrange(flights, desc(is.na(dep_time)))

# Sort flights to find the most delayed flights. 
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))

# Find the flights that left earliest.
arrange(flights, dep_delay)

# Sort flights to find the fastest flights.
# Note: I am assuming that this means the shortest air time, not the fastest 
#       flight speed
arrange(flights, air_time)

# Which flights travelled the longest? Which travelled the shortest?
arrange(flights, desc(distance))
arrange(flights, distance)

# 5.4 Select columns with select() ---------------------------------------------

# Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, 
# and arr_delay from flights.

flights %>% select("dep_time", "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay")
flights %>% select(4,6,7,9)

flights %>% select("dep_time", "dep_delay":"arr_time", "arr_delay")
flights %>% select(4,6:7,9)

flights %>% select(4:9, -5, -8)
flights %>% select("dep_time":"arr_delay", -"sched_dep_time", -"sched_arr_time")

flights %>% select(4:9, -c(5, 8))
flights %>% select("dep_time":"arr_delay", -c("sched_dep_time", "sched_arr_time"))

flights %>% select("dep_time":"arr_delay", -contains("sched"))
flights %>% select(contains("dep"), contains("arr"), -contains("sched"))

flights %>% select(starts_with("dep"), starts_with("arr"))
flights %>% select(ends_with("time"), ends_with("delay"), 
                   -contains("sched"), -contains("air"))

flights %>% select(everything(), -c(1:3, 5,8, 10:19))
flights %>% select((1:last_col()), -c(1:3, 5,8, 10:last_col()))

# What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a 
# select() call?
  
flights %>% select(dep_time, dep_time, dep_delay)
# Answer: The column will only be included once in the returned dataframe

# What does the one_of() function do? 
# Answer: The one_of() function is a helper function to the tidyverse' select()
#         function.  It matches variable names in a character vector

# Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?
vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep", "arr_delay")

# Answer: You can create a vector to store the names of variables that you 
#         would like to call, and then call the vector using the one_of() 
#         function in conjunction with the select_function.  This will be 
#         especially useful if you expect to need to call the same set of
#         variables regularly. 
#         See example below:
flights %>% select(one_of(vars))

# Does the result of running the following code surprise you? 
select(flights, contains("TIME"))
# Answer: Yes.  R is usually case sensitive.

# How do the select helpers deal with case by default? 
# Answer:  By default, the select helpers will ignore case. 

# How can you change that default?
# You can tell the select helpers not to ignore case by using the argument
# ignore.case = FALSE


# 5.5 Add new variables with mutate() ------------------------------------------

# Currently dep_time and sched_dep_time are convenient to look at, but hard to 
# compute with because theyâ€™re not really continuous numbers. 
# Convert them to a more convenient representation of number of minutes since 
# midnight.

flight_times<-flights %>%
  mutate(dep_hour = dep_time %/% 100,
         dep_minute = dep_time %% 100,
         dep_min_past_midnight = dep_hour * 60 + dep_minute,
         sched_dep_hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100,
         sched_dep_minute = sched_dep_time %% 100,
         sched_dep_min_past_mid = sched_dep_hour * 60 + sched_dep_minute) %>%
  select(-c(dep_hour, dep_minute, sched_dep_hour, sched_dep_minute))


# Compare air_time with arr_time - dep_time. 
flight_compare <- flights %>%
  mutate(wrong_calc = arr_time - dep_time) %>%
  select(air_time, wrong_calc, arr_time, dep_time) %>%
  print(nrows=Inf)

# What do you expect to see? What do you see? What do you need to do to fix it?
# Answer: I expect that air_time and the result of arr_time - dep_time will
#         be different. My expectation was correct: arr_time and dep_time were
#         treated as integers because of the way they were stored (as objects of 
#         class: "integer" not class "datetime"). To fix it, I could either
#         create new variables representing arr_time and dep_time as the number
#         of minutes past midnight, or convert them to class: "datetime" 


# Compare dep_time, sched_dep_time, and dep_delay. 
# How would you expect those three numbers to be related?
  
# Answer: As with the question above, I would not expect to be able to 
#         accurately calculate dep_delay from dep_time and sched_dep_time 
#         without first converting dep_time and sched_dep_time to new variables
#         representing the number of minutes past midnight, or objects of the
#         class "datetime."  Without these changes, I would only expect the
#         calculation to output accurate results when the dep_time and 
#         sched_dep_time are within the same hour

# Find the 10 most delayed flights using a ranking function. How do you want to 
# handle ties? Carefully read the documentation for min_rank().
flight_delays<-flights %>%
  mutate(most_delayed = min_rank(desc(dep_delay))) %>%
  arrange(most_delayed) %>%
  head(10)


# What does 1:3 + 1:10 return? Why?
1:3 + 1:10
# Answer:  The code returns a vecter with the following values:
#          Vector: 2  4  6  5  7  9  8 10 12 11
#          This vectorized funtion uses 'recycling' rules, repeating the values 
#          in the shorter vector until it matches the length of the longer 
#          vector
#          

# What trigonometric functions does R provide?
# Answer: R provides the following trigonometric functions: cos(), sin(), tan(), 
# acos(), asin(), atan(), atan2(), cospi(), sinpi(), tanpi() 


# 5.6 Grouped summaries with summarize() ---------------------------------------

# Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay 
# characteristics of a group of flights. 

# Narrow the dataset to exclude cancelled flights
not_cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))

# Mean arrival delay, mean arrival delay among flights with a positive delay,
# Median arrival delay, median arrival delay among flights with a positive delay
delay_averages <- not_cancelled%>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay),
    mean_pos_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay[arr_delay>0]),
    median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay),
    median_pos_arr_delay = median(arr_delay[arr_delay>0])
    )

# Percent of flights that arrive late(any amount), that arrive more than 
# 30 minutes late, and that arrive more than 60 minutes late
lateness_percentages <- not_cancelled%>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    pct_late = mean(arr_delay > 0),
    pct_more_than_30min_late = mean(arr_delay > 30),
    pct_more_than_1hr_late = mean(arr_delay > 60)
    )

# Mean delay among flights that departed late, that departed 30 to 60 minutes late, 
# and that departed more than 60 minutes late
delays_of_late_deps <- not_cancelled%>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    arr_delay_late_deps = mean(arr_delay[dep_delay>0]),
    arr_delay_late_deps_30to60 = mean(arr_delay[dep_delay >= 30 & dep_delay < 60]),
    arr_delay_late_deps_60plus = mean(arr_delay[dep_delay > 60]),
  )   

# Which is more important: arrival delay or departure delay?
# Answer:  As a customer, I would argue that arrival delay is more important.
#          It doesn't really matter if the plane departs late, as long as
#          it arrives on time. 


#Come up with another approach that will give you the same output as 
# not_cancelled %>% count(dest) #and 
# not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance) #(without using count()).
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(count = n())

not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarize(total_miles = sum(distance, na.rm = TRUE))

# Our definition of cancelled flights (is.na(dep_delay) | is.na(arr_delay) )
# is slightly suboptimal. Why? Which is the most important column?

# Answer: The definition includes flights that have a value for arrival delay
#         but a missing value for departure delay,(which would likely indicate 
#         that the flight did, in fact, depart - since it must have departed in 
#         order to arrive).  It also includes flights that have a value for 
#         departure delay but a missing value for arrival delay.  This could 
#         indicate missing data, or a flight that didn't arrive. (Perhaps due 
#         to being rerouted, returning to the departure airport, or crashing?)
#         Of the two, arr_delay is the most important column. 

  
# Look at the number of cancelled flights per day. Is there a pattern? 
flights_cancellations <- flights %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarize(scheduled_flights = n(),
            not_cancelled = sum((!is.na(dep_delay) & !is.na(arr_delay))),
            cancelled = sum((is.na(dep_delay) & is.na(arr_delay))))

# Answer: To examine the number of cancelled flights per day, I used a slightly
#         different definition - I defined 'cancelled' as flights that were
#         had a missing value for departure delay AND had a missing value for 
#         arrival delay. 

#         Scrolling through the output, you can see that higher numbers of 
#         delayed flights are "clumped" across consecutive days.  This may be 
#         due to storms or bad weather.  


# Is the proportion of cancelled flights related to the average delay?
flights_cancel_delay <- flights %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarize(scheduled_flights = n(),
            not_cancelled = sum((!is.na(dep_delay) & !is.na(arr_delay))),
            cancelled = sum((is.na(dep_delay) & is.na(arr_delay))),
            proportion_cancelled = cancelled/scheduled_flights,
            mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(flights_cancel_delay, aes(x = mean_arr_delay, y = proportion_cancelled)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()

#Answer: Yes.  The mean arrival delay and the proportion of flights that are
#        cancelled are positively correlated. 


# Which carrier has the worst delays? 
flights_worst<-flights %>%
group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarize(scheduled_flights = n(),
            cancelled = sum((is.na(dep_delay) & is.na(arr_delay))),
            mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) 

flights_worst %>% arrange(desc(mean_arr_delay)) %>% head(20)

# Answer: F9 is the carrier with the highest mean delays. This does not
#         take into account the number of flights per day. However, the airline
#         685 flights scheduled - a fairly large sample size. 

# Challenge: can you disentangle the effects of bad airports vs. bad carriers? 
# Why/why not? (Hint: think about 
# flights %>% group_by(carrier, dest) %>% summarise(n()))

flights_worst2<-flights %>%
  group_by(carrier, dest) %>%
  summarize(scheduled_flights = n(),
            cancelled = sum((is.na(dep_delay) & is.na(arr_delay))),
            mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) 

flights_worst2 %>% arrange(desc(mean_arr_delay)) %>% head(20)

# Answer: When you disaggregate by destination, the carrier 'F9' loses its
#         place as the airline with the highest mean delays.  

# What does the sort argument to count() do. When might you use it?
?count
# Answer: "sort = TRUE" will cause the output to be sorted in descending order 
#          of n.  You could use it to learn the group with the highest count 
#          of something: for instance the highest number of cancelled flights.
